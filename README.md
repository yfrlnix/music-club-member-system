## How It Works

### 1. Add Member

Fill out the form and upload a profile picture.

- System validates if the uploaded file is a real image
- Checks file type and file size limit
- Saves image inside `public/uploads/avatars`
- Stores image path in the database

---

### 2. View Members

Displays 5 members per page.

- Pagination links for navigation
- Profile pictures displayed beside member information
- Edit and Delete buttons available for each member

---

### 3. Search Members

Filter members by username.

- Search results also support pagination

---

### 4. Edit Member

Update existing member information.

- Form is pre-filled with existing data
- User can upload a new profile photo
- Old photo is automatically removed
- Existing photo remains if no new file is uploaded

---

### 5. Delete Member

Remove a member permanently.

- Deletes profile photo from uploads folder
- Removes database record
- Includes confirmation prompt before deletion

---

## CRUD Operations Completed

- **Create** – Add new member with photo upload
- **Read** – View member list with pagination and search
- **Update** – Edit member information and profile picture
- **Delete** – Remove member and associated image

---

## Validation Rules Implemented
